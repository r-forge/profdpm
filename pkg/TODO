profDensity:
0. possibly remove this public function and keep code for reference, as it generally does not perform well and profLinear duplicates the functionality.

profLinear:
0. check log posterior computation
1. provide stopping criterion functionality
2. remove missing observations before C call (issue warning)
3. add a summary method for profLinear
4. add a plot method for profLinear
5. modify code and add functions for interfacing with C functions
6. build better example code
7. write a script for testing and benchmarking (Hamming dist.)
8. revise help files
9. consider adding 'verbose' option to public function for debugging info
