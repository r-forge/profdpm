Description: This package facilitates profile inference (inference at a point estimate, often the posterior mode) for a class of product partition models (PPM). The Dirichlet process mixture is a specific case in this class and is selected by default. These methods search for the maximum posterior (MAP) estimate for the data partition in a PPM.
